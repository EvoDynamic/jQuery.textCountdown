# jQuery.textCountdown
jQuery plug-in to add a span below (or styled elsewhere) a textarea or input.

Next steps: turn this into a widget plugin. Why? to contain the state in a more "best practice" manner. Plus, I want to add a 'check' method so that an update can be manually triggered when the field is updated by code (jQuery or Angular)
